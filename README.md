RadioTrack Lineside
==================

RadioTrack Lineside has been created as part of [Benjamin Hill](http://imbenjam.in)'s Final Year Project, part of studying for BSc (Hons) Computing at [Bournemouth University](http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk).


The purpose of the Reader application (‘RadioTrack Lineside’) is to provide a host interface between the RFID reader device and the RadioTrack system. The application reads an RFID tag as it passes near the reader device, then interacts with the database to retrieve the vehicle information associated with the RFID tag ID, and updates the database with the vehicle’s new location identified by that application instance.
